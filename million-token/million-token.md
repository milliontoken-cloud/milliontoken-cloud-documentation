{% embed url="https://milliontoken.org" %}

> Million is a decentralized digital currency with a limited supply of 1,000,000 tokens pegged to a minimum value of 1.00 $USDC, for a total market cap of 1,000,000+ $USDC. Million was founded by ex-Google / ex-Facebook [Tech Lead](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechLead) with over 1,000,000 subscribers on YouTube \(as a millionaire\).
>
> As Million gains popularity and usage, the value may increase above the initial peg-value of 1.00 $USDC. For example, if 1000 people each want 1000 Millions, the fair market value of Million is 1.00 $USDC each. If 2000 people each want 1000 Millions, the fair market value of Million rises to 2.00 $USDC, thereby increasing the market cap of Million to 2 million $USDC. Over time, the price of Million may reach 10 million, 100 million, or even higher.
